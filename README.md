# payrollapplication
I created a basic module to deploy multiple environments of the same infrastructure so that applications can be deployed across several countries. Each country will have its own instance of the software deployed on aws cloud using the same architecture. This stack has a single ec2 instance with a custom ami that will host the server and dynamodb nosql database that will be used to store employee and payroll data. The s3 bucket will be used to store documents such as paystubs and tax forms. Users access the application, which is hosted on an ec2 instance. This architecture dosenâ€™t consider vpc endpoints of iam rules for these services. This terraform module can be used to deploy the same stack of resources in different countries.
